Mary loves everyone,"∀x (L(M, x)), where L is a predicate representing the ""loves"" relation, M is a constant representing Mary, and x is a variable representing an individual in the domain. The domain should include all individuals that Mary could potentially love."
No one talks,"∀x, ¬(Talks(x))"
Mary likes every person,"∀x (likes(Mary, x))"

Everyone loves everyone,"∀x ∀y (L(x, y) ∧ x ∈ U ∧ y ∈ U)

Here, U represents the domain of individuals, L(x, y) represents the predicate ""loves"" between individuals x and y, and the double universal quantifier (∀x ∀y) is used to express that every individual in the domain loves every other individual in the domain."
A student smiles,∃x (Student(x) ∧ Smiles(x))
Every student smiles,"∀x (S(x) → Sm(x))

Here, we define the domain of discourse to be the set of all students. The predicate S(x) represents 'x is a student', and Sm(x) represents 'x smiles'. The universal quantifier ∀x indicates that the statement holds for every student in the domain. The implication (→) connects the predicate S(x) with Sm(x), meaning that if x is a student, then x smiles."
Every student except John dances,∀x (Student(x) ∧ ¬John(x) → Dances(x))

John is not a llama,∀x ( (x = john) → ¬(x = llama) )
Not all those who wander are lost,"∀x (W(x) → ¬L(x))

Let's define the following predicates:
- W(x): x is a person who wanders
- L(x): x is a person who is lost

The sentence ""Not all those who wander are lost"" can be translated into first-order logic as above, stating that for all x in the domain, if x wanders (W(x)), then x is not lost (¬L(x))."
No people who wander are lost,∀x (wanders(x) → ¬lost(x))
John does not love anyone,"∀x (¬(loves(john, x)))"
John does not love everyone,"∀x (¬(loves(john, x)))"
Everyone who sees Mary loves Mary,"∀x (sees(x, Mary) → loves(x, Mary))"
Everyone loves someone,"∀x ∃y (Loves(x, y))"

"If anyone cheats, he suffers",∀x (C(x) → S(x))
"If anyone cheats, the person suffers",∀x (C(x) → S(x))
"If anyone cheats, a person suffers",∃x (Cheats(x) → ∃y (Suffers(y)))
"If anyone cheats, everyone suffers","∀x (Cx → S)

Let's define the domain of discourse as a set of individuals, represented by x. We introduce two unary predicates: C(x) to represent the fact that individual x cheats, and S(x) to represent the fact that individual x suffers. The sentence can be translated into first-order logic as follows: for all x in the domain, if x cheats (Cx), then everyone suffers (S). The logical representation uses the universal quantifier (∀x) and the material implication (→) to express the conditional relationship between cheating and suffering."
"If someone cheats, everybody else suffers",∀x (Cheats(x) → ∀y (Suffers(y) ∧ y ≠ x))
"If somebody cheats, everybody else suffers","∀x (Cx → ∀y (Nxy → Sy))

In this representation, we define the domain of individuals as 'x' and 'y'. 'Cx' represents the predicate that an individual 'x' cheats, 'Nxy' represents the predicate that individual 'x' does not suffer and individual 'y' suffers, and 'Sy' represents the predicate that individual 'y' suffers. The logical representation states that for all individuals 'x', if 'x' cheats, then for all individuals 'y', if 'x' does not suffer and 'y' suffers, 'y' suffers. This captures the meaning and structure of the original sentence while preserving its logical consistency."
Mary loves everyone except John,"∀x ( (x = John ∧ Loves(Mary, x)) → ¬Loves(Mary, x) ) ∧ ∀x ( (x ≠ John ∧ Loves(Mary, x)) → Loves(Mary, x) )"

- ∀x and ∀y represent universal quantifiers, ranging over all individuals x and y, respectively.
- Lx∀y represents the predicate ""loves"" with x as the subject and y as the object.
- Lex represents the predicate ""loves"" with x as the subject and himself (x) as the object."

Please don't leave your belongings behind,"∀x (P(x) → ¬L(x)) ∧ ∀x∀y (L(x) ∧ P(y) → x ≠ y)

In this representation, we define the following predicates and constants:
- P(x): x is a belonging.
- L(x): x is left behind.

The sentence ""Please don't leave your belongings behind"" can be translated into FOL as ""For all x, if x is a belonging, then x is not left behind, and for all x and y, if x is left behind and y is a belonging, then x is not equal to y."" This representation captures the meaning of the original sentence by stating that all belongings should not be left behind and that no two belongings should be left behind at the same time."

- x represents an individual from the relevant domain (e.g., people in a certain time period or population)
- wanted(x, president) represents the proposition that individual x wanted to become president
- ∀ denotes universal quantification, meaning that the statement holds for all individuals in the domain."

In this representation, we define the following predicates:
- Child(x): x is a child

The universal quantifier (∀x) applies to all elements in the domain, and the implication (→) represents the ""usually"" aspect of the sentence, indicating that small children are typically curious."

where:

- Reward(x) is a unary predicate that holds if x is rewarding
- Completed(x) is a unary predicate that holds if x is completed
- VeryRewarding(x) is a unary predicate that holds if x is very rewarding

The logical representation states that for all tasks x, if x is a daunting task, then when x is both completed and rewarding, it is very rewarding."

In this representation:
- P(x) represents that x is a person.
- L(x, y) represents that x is telling y what to do.
- U(x, y) represents that x is unqualified to tell y what to do.
- Q(x, y) represents that y dislikes being told what to do by x.

The universal quantifier ∀x applies to all people, and the implication states that if x is a person and for all y (if y is a person, then if x is unqualified to tell y what to do, then x does not tell y what to do), then for all y (if y is a person, then x does not tell y what to do and x is unqualified to tell y what to do). This captures the meaning of the origina"
